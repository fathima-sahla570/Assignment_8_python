Data visualization is a crucial aspect of data analysis, allowing us to represent complex datasets in a graphical format for better understanding and insights. This assignment focuses on creating various types of plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn, two powerful Python libraries for data visualization.

In this assignment, you will complete three exercises that demonstrate your ability to generate meaningful visualizations:

Line Plot 

A line plot will be created using matplotlib.pyplot to display population growth over time for four different cities. Each city will be represented by a unique line, and the x-axis will represent the years, while the y-axis will show the population.
Scatter Plot

A scatter plot will be created using seaborn to analyze the relationship between the number of hours studied and the test scores obtained by students. This visualization helps in understanding how study time impacts performance.
Bar Chart 

A bar chart will be created using matplotlib.pyplot to represent total sales across different months of the year. Each bar corresponds to a month, making it easy to compare monthly sales performance.
Through these exercises, you will enhance your data visualization skills and gain experience in presenting data effectively. These plots are widely used in real-world data analysis, business intelligence, and research to communicate insights clearly.
